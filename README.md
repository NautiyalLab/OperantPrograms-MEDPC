# OperantPrograms-MEDPC
This repository is a place to store, organize, and update MEDPC code used for stimulus delivery and data recording for MedAssociates operant chambers in the Nautiyal Lab.
Programs are organized by experiment or reinforcment schedule type, then by older programs used at Columbia/Dartmouth versus currently in use.
